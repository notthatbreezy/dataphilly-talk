 Reuters reported: 
 Venezuelan opposition leader Henrique Capriles charged on Sunday there was a plot to change the result of the country’s presidential election, which will decide if a longtime loyalist continues Hugo Chavez’s self-styled socialist revolution. 
 The mood was triumphal by mid-evening at the headquarters of acting President Nicolas Maduro, who led Capriles in most polls heading into Sunday’s vote, buoyed by Chavez’s blessing before he died from cancer last month. 
 Capriles, a 40-year-old state governor, called on the National Electoral Commission to close polling stations that were due to shut their doors at 6 p.m. (6:30 p.m. ET/2230 GMT), unless there were still lines of people waiting. 
 “We alert the country and the world of the intention to try and change the will expressed by the people,” Capriles said in a Twitter message, without giving details. 
 Government officials described the allegation as irresponsible and said it ran the risk of adding to a tense atmosphere, which led to isolated scuffles at some centers. 
 “For a few days the ‘anti-Chavistas’ have been trying to create an absurd notion of fraud in an automated voting system, one that is recognized in the whole world as secure, trustworthy and transparent,” said Maduro’s campaign chief Jorge Rodriguez. 
 Daniel from Venezuela News and Views tweeted out the Capriles press conference. The Capriles camp is very upbeat after the voting today.
