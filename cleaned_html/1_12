He added however that his presidency was "defined by things that you 
 didn't necessarily want to have happen", such as the September 11, 2001 
 terrorist attacks and Hurricane Katrina. 
 
 
Despite the constant criticism since leaving office, especially from his 
 successor Barack Obama, Mr Bush said he is not interested in "self pity". 
 
"I'm comfortable with what I did. I'm comfortable with who I am," he 
 declared. 
 
 
In the interview, he shied away from Mr Obama's claims that he inherited a 
 mess of an economy from his predecessor. 
 
 
"My only point is that when there's an objective analysis of our fiscal 
 record, people will say, 'Well, that's different than I thought.'"
 
 
The former president, who now lives in Dallas with his wife Laura and 
 became a grandfather for the first time at the weekend, also 
 called on his Republican party to revert to the "compassionate 
 conservatism" by which he claims to have been guided, as well as 
 address with the immigration debate with a "benevolent spirit". 
 
 
Nonetheless, he said he has "no burning desire" to re-enter the 
 day-to-day political scene. 
 
 
"People ask me, 'What about the economy?'" he said. "My answer 
 is, 'Why don't you go hire an economist?"
 
 
He said he is enjoying his retirement, spending his days mountain biking, as 
 well as painting.
 
 
“People are surprised,” he said. “Of course, some people are surprised I can 
 even read.”
 
 
The George W Bush Presidential Centre will be dedicated on April 25 on the 
 campus of Southern Methodist University in Dallas.
