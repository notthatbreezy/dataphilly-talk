 
     
     
     From a local news station: “Sources tell CBS 11 that Former Justice of the Peace Eric Williams will be charged with capital murder in the deaths of Mike and Cynthia McLelland, and Mark Hasse.” It’s not a white supremacist gang member or Mexican cartel thug, but just some guy they prosecuted for a relatively minor crime : 
 
 His arrest came after federal, state, and local investigators executed a search warrant at his house and his in-laws house Friday afternoon and night as they investigate the murders of former Kaufman County District Attorney Mike McLelland, his wife Cynthia, and assistant DA Mark Hasse. 
 . . . . 
 Earlier this month, the CBS 11 I-Team reported Williams had a history with both Mike McLelland and Mark Hasse. The two prosecuted and secured a conviction against him back in 2012 for Burglary and Theft By A Public Servant. Surveillance cameras caught Williams taking computer equipment from a county building. As part of his appeal, Williams claimed McClelland and Hasse didn’t like him. 
 Anonymous sources say capital murder charges are likely. They have not publicly revealed what evidence they have to support these charges. 
 We’ll stay on top of the story. Thanks to SarahW.

	 So he was yet another government employee in charge of keeping the little people in control? 
 The Texas Constitution requires that each county in the State establish between one and eight justice of the peace precincts, depending upon the population of the county. Also, depending on the population of the precinct, either one or two justice of the peace courts are to be established in each precinct. There are approximately 820 justice of the peace courts in Texas. 
 Justice of the peace courts have original jurisdiction in Class C misdemeanor criminal cases, which are less serious minor offenses. These courts also have jurisdiction of minor civil matters. A justice of the peace may issue search or arrest warrants, and may serve as the coroner in counties where there is no provision for a medical examiner. These courts also function as small claims courts. 
 When are we going to take guns and automatic carry/concealed carry rights for government employees–If it just saves one life… 
 I should add–My respects to Texas for being a bit more sane than California–In almost every respect.

	 Wow. One cannot help but wonder how much sooner this horrible case might have been solved– and even possibly the second set of lives saved– had law enforcement not also had to focus (justifiably) on the big story possibilities (cartels and supremacists killing prosecutors).

	 When Mark Hesse was murdered the first person Mike McLelland pointed the finger at was Eric Williams. However, because Williams tested clear for gunpowder residue they had to let him go. 
 I’m not faulting the cops, as a Justice of the Peace Williams would know the ins-n-outs of police procedure and of evidence collection. He might have gotten away with the first murder if he hadn’t killed the McLellands.

I think they figured the rogue video thing had already been used–see Benghazi. 
So a pissed-off JP is the answer. 
I sincerely hope so.

	 At issue were three computer monitors taken from a county storage area. Two of the monitors were found in Williams’ county office, according to testimony. The third was located in his truck. 
 Wait a second. He “takes” 3 monitors from “a county storage area” and two are found in his county office and a third in his truck that he says he was going to take for use in the jail? 
He “stole” county equipment from a storage area to use in his county office? 
 This sounds bizarre. There is no justification for revenge murder, but this sounds bizarre from beginning to end from what little we have.

	 there’s bizarre and then there’s bizarre 
 it sounds like a county employee fetches some computer monitors from storage and puts them in his office himself instead of waiting for the official paperwork and union workers to get it for him 
and then he gets charged with a crime, humiliated in public, and loses his job 
 sounds like a personal feud from way back for some unknown reason

	 DRJ, thanks very much for those links. My keyboard began acting up or I would have thanked you yesterday. (The delete/backspace key just up and quit.) I think it draws his character and lurking homicidal inclinations pretty well, even if he were truly wronged with regard to the theft charges, IMO. 
 17. Oh of course you were teasing me, Patrick. I’m much more banny on myself than you would ever be on a commenter and never would be on a good-faith participant. Dustin’s right about the intent if not the effect of my reply.

	 A little more filling out of details 
 http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2013/04/15/eric-williams-arrested-after-shooting-deaths-of-texas-prosecutors.html 
 about the monitor thefts. The context and details put some darker shade on Williams’ actions. 
	 Comment by SarahW (b0e533) — 4/15/2013 @ 7:05 am  
	  
 
	  
	 Even viewing the appropriation of the few monitors in the light most favorable to Williams, there was an undercurrent of widespread feeling that there was something seriously wrong with him. 
 
“Everybody that’s had anything to do with him is terrified of him,” McLelland said of Williams. “And if nothing else, two years in the state jail would give them some piece of mind for at least 24 months. That’s worth something.” 
	 Comment by SarahW (b0e533) — 4/15/2013 @ 7:09 am  
	  
 
	  
	 MD, you’re right, I can’t imagine that Williams would be convicted of theft and dismissed from an elected office for taking the computer monitors. There has to be much more to it, and likely we’ll hear about it at trial. 
 BTW, notice in the posted quote Williams was convicted of: 
 Burglary and Theft By A Public Servant. Surveillance cameras caught Williams taking computer equipment from a county building. 
 Which is not quite the same thing as Williams taking computer monitors from county storage to use in his office and at the county jail. 
 Williams’ claims of bias by the prosecutors notwithstanding, an assertion of bias in the news report may be valid.
