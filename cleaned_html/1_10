President. Governor. Artist? More than four years after George W. Bush left the White House, the President said in an exclusive interview with The Dallas Morning News that he has taken up painting, an activity in which he takes “great delight in busting stereotypes.” “People are surprised,” he said. “Of course, some people are surprised I can even read.” As the George W. Bush Presidential Center prepares to open, Bush's team has released some images of his paintings to the Morning News. “It’s a way to create,” Bush said. “I enjoy creating. … You can express yourself in a way that’s unique.” The
art came about a year or so ago, after Bush did some “doodles to
communicate with our girls.” His wife showed them to Dallas artist
Pamela Nelson, a longtime friend, who thought the former president might
have some talent. Bush thought Nelson was joking. But he had read the book Painting as a Pastime, 
written by another famous amateur painter, Winston Churchill. After
further scoping out the British prime minister’s work, he decided to
give it a try. Bush connected with Gail Norfleet, a Dallas artist
and SMU graduate who offers some private instruction. He now paints
almost daily. He takes lessons from Norfleet about once a week. He
paints lots of pets, but also landscapes and still-lifes. Bush judged his rendering of Barney as “a good painting because it was painted with affection.” The
former president said the hobby is all about having a fun and
interesting challenge. Nelson, who’s tracked Bush’s progress, said she’s
been impressed by his focus and discipline. “He’s pretty fearless as an artist,” she said. Bush demurred about his talent, saying that “thus far, the signature is more valuable than the painting.” That signature? “43,” his place in the order of presidents.
