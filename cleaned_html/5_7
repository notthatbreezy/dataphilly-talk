John Kerry spouts off leftist nonsense. 
 
 John Kerry told CNN this weekend that Japanese students are afraid of attending school in the US because they’re afraid of guns. 
 CNN reported: 
 Students in other countries assessing where to study abroad are increasingly scared of coming to the United States because of gun violence, the nation’s top diplomat said Monday. 
 Speaking with CNN foreign affairs correspondent Jill Dougherty in Tokyo, Secretary of State John Kerry said he’d discussed the situation with officials there who said students felt unsafe in the United States. 
 “We had an interesting discussion about why fewer students are coming to, particularly from Japan, to study in the United States, and one of the responses I got from our officials from conversations with parents here is that they’re actually scared. They think they’re not safe in the United States and so they don’t come,” Kerry said. 
 He noted Japan’s restrictive gun laws – which prevent private ownership of nearly all firearms, including handguns – and said the country was safer “where people are not running around with guns.”… 
 … Figures have shown international study is down markedly among Japanese students to all destinations , including the United States. Experts have attributed the decline to Japan’s low birthrate , the expense of foreign study in a poor economy, and a desire among Japanese young people to remain at home rather than venture to other countries. 
 For the record - More foreign students are studying in the US today than ever before. Enrollments have been on the upswing since 2006-07 and grew 32% over the past decade .
