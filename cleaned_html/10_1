The end of Marco Rubio? 
	
	 
		 
			 It's his "liberal"  position on immigration may cost Rubio a run at the presidency some time in  the future.  But will it?  Maybe how he handles that position is what will determine his political viability on the right.  
  
 By joining the cause, the potential 2016 presidential candidate has  
set himself down a politically risky path — one that could pay big  
dividends but is likely to become even more treacherous after details of 
 the bill become public. Shortly after Rubio’s talk-show appearances,  
NumbersUSA, a conservative anti-immigration group, issued a statement  
denouncing the “Obama-Rubio-Schumer” deal. And Sen. Jeff Sessions  
(R-Ala.) charged that his colleagues had “abandoned” a pledge to make  
border security the highest priority.  
 “I am not the self-appointed 
 anything,” Rubio said Sunday on CNN’s “State of the Union” after host  
Candy Crowley called him the Republican face of immigration reform.  
“I’ve worked on this bill, and . . . part of my job is to explain to people what it is we’ve worked on, try to justify it and hopefully gain their support.”  
 Although 
 his colleagues believe he’s “all in,” how Rubio manages the public  
debate and fends off attacks on the legislation could go a long way in  
determining how much credit — or blame — the young senator walks away with in the first major policy gambit of his career. ... WaPo
