While the media was ignorning the “local crime story” of the murder trial of Dr. Kermit Gosness, they were all over the story of the murdered prosecutors down in Texas. The aspect of the story they were focused on was the suspicion that white supremecists were the culprits. Now that that angle hasn’t panned out, expect the coverage to cease immediately . If the latest news out of Kaufman County, Texas, is to be believed, this whole theory about “white supremacists” was entirely wrong — a complete waste of time, a  misdirection from the actual culprit : The day after the bodies of Kaufman County District Attorney Mike McLelland and his wife were found, an anonymous email went to county officials threatening another attack if the writer’s demands were not met. Law enforcement authorities have since traced the threat to the personal computer of Eric Williams, a former justice of the peace who is now the prime suspect in the slayings. He is expected to be charged with capital murder as early as Tuesday, law enforcement authorities said Sunday. Authorities on Saturday found numerous weapons inside a Seagoville storage unit linked to Williams as well as a car similar to the one seen leaving the McLellands’ neighborhood on the morning of the Easter weekend slayings. “It’s a very good feeling when the pieces start to fall into place,” one law enforcement official said Sunday. The pieces might have fallen into place earlier — Mark Haase’s murder might have been solved, and Williams arrested before McLelland was killed –  if law enforcement hadn’t wasted time chasing the “white supremacist” wild goose, when  the D.A. himself tried to tell them who murdered Mark Haase : There’s much more at the link, be sure to read the whole thing .
