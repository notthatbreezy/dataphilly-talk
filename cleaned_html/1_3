(CNN) - Former first couple George W. and Laura Bush said Sunday they were "elated" at the news their daughter Jenna had given birth to a girl. 
 "Laura and I are thrilled to announce the birth of our grandchild, Margaret Laura 'Mila' Hager," the first-time grandparents wrote in a statement, noting the new addition to the Bush family was named for her grandmothers. 
 
"She was born last night, April 13, at 8:43pm in New York City. We met our beautiful granddaughter today. Jenna and Mila are healthy. And our family is elated," they continued. 
 Jenna Bush Hager, 31, announced in December that she was expecting her first child, who is also the first grandchild for the former president and his wife. At the time, she said she was "nervous and so excited" about the pregnancy. 
 "I'm a first-time mom, but it's something I've always wanted. I'm a teacher and I love kids," Bush Hager said on NBC's "Today Show," where she is a contributor. 
 She appeared on the show with her husband, Henry Hager, whom she married in 2008 on her family's 1,600-acre ranch in Crawford, Texas. Hager said his wife would "instill wonderful values" in their new baby. 
 The former president, who phoned into the show along with his wife, Laura, declared he was "fired up" about becoming a grandfather but that he wasn't planning on changing any diapers in the near future. 
 "I'll be the guy in the Ford 250 driving around the ranch with the grandchild," George W. Bush said. 
 Later this month, the 43rd president will open his presidential library, situated on the campus of Southern Methodist University in Dallas.
