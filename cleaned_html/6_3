Happy Tax Day, everyone! While many of us were scrambling to file our returns, the Obamas released their tax information — and this morning, Joe Scarborough made it abundantly clear that he was not happy with what he saw. After years of asserting the wealthy should pay their “fair share,” he charged, President Obama himself paid 18.4 percent in taxes on an income of roughly $608,000? “The hypocrisy in mind boggling.” 
 After attacking Mitt Romney for how much he pays in taxes, Scarborough couldn’t help but note that “ class warrior ” Obama isn’t paying a particularly high rate either. “And he talks about fairness?” 
 “Does limousine liberal apply in this case?” Scarborough asked. The Washington Post ‘s David Ignatius was much less heated, noting that sometimes substantial charitable contributions lower the tax rate — and that the low rate doesn’t undermine the president’s overall argument about taxes. Scarborough countered that Romney, too, had substantial charitable contributions, but he was still attacked. “Eighteen percent is 18 percent,” he insisted. 
 “I support the Buffett rule,” Scarborough later added, and the president shouldn’t have paid less than 30 percent. “Don’t lecture me for a year and a half…if you’re paying tax rates in the teens.” 
 “I think there are a lot of Republicans who would agree with me,” he added, noting we need a 30-percent minimum. It’s “a bad example” for the president to be paying such a low tax rate after he “demagogued” the issue for so long.
