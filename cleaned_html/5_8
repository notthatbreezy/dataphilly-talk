Citing the declining number of foreign students coming to the United States, secretary of state John Kerry argued that guns in America are frightening them away. In an interview with CNN’s foreign affairs correspondent Jill Dougherty in Tokyo, Kerry said that Japanese students in particular “think they’re not safe in the United States and so they don’t come.”  
 
	Kerry contended that Japanese youth feel safer in their country, which has highly restrictive gun-control policies, and “where people are not running around with guns.”
