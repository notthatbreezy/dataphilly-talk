 In spite of their long relationship and a cover story in the New York Times Sunday Magazine , Chuck Schumer would offer only a “no comment” when asked repeatedly about former Congressman Anthony Weiner. 
 New York Senator Chuck Schumer laughed off questions from ABC’s Jonathan Karl about his former protege’s mayoral prospects on This Week. A grinning Schumer said “no comment” to Karl twice during the end of his segment. 
 After almost two years out of the limelight, former New York Congressman Anthony Weiner is making headlines again over a possible mayoral candidacy. Karl wasn’t expecting any endorsements in the race for New York City mayor but he was surprised that Schumer had no words at all on the former congressman. 
 “I am not commenting,” said Schumer after being asked by Karl on a second chance for Weiner. 
 Karl was stunned by Schumer’s response. “No comment at all? That is rare that we have Senator Schumer with no comment,” said Karl.
