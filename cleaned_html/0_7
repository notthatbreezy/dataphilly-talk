 
 
 Yemeni detainee Samir Naji al Hasan Moqbel is one of the many prisoners at Guantanammo on a hunger strike. He has been held for 11 years, never been charged with a crime, and cleared for release.  
 
 He tells his story in an op-ed in the New York Times, Guantanamo is Killing me . It's very disturbing to read. You wouldn't do a dog this way.  
 
 Shame on us. The U.S. needs to send these men home.
