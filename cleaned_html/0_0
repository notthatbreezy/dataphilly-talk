 

		I spoke earlier about how fear is keeping Congress from allowing President Obama to close the prison in Guantanamo Bay. This is the consequence of that fear. It's a credit to our country that a detainee can get himself heard in the pages of the New York Times . But a truly decent country would do something about it. We don't. We don't because we have too many cowards in office. We have too many cowards in office because too many of us are cowards.  
 
I am ashamed of you. I am ashamed that we are so afraid that we will tolerate injustice on a massive scale just to avoid having to feel any small pang of fear.
