IT’S A GIRL!!! 
 Congratulations to Jenna Bush Hager and her husband Henry Hager on the birth of their daughter, Margaret Laura ‘Mila’ Hager .  The baby was named after her two grandmothers and already has a nickname — “Mila.”  It would appear that this is a Bush family tradition, as Jenna and twin Barbara were named after their grandmothers, too. 31  year old Jenna Bush Hager, wow, I cannot believe she is 31, where have the years gone, gave birth to her first child last night, April 13, at 8:43pm in New York City and an undisclosed NYC hospital. 
 Former first couple George W. and Laura Bush said Sunday they were “elated” at the news their daughter Jenna had given birth to a girl. 
 “Laura and I are thrilled to announce the birth of our grandchild, Margaret Laura ‘Mila’ Hager,” the first-time grandparents wrote in a statement, noting the new addition to the Bush family was named for her grandmothers. 
 “She was born last night, April 13, at 8:43pm in New York City. We met our beautiful granddaughter today. Jenna and Mila are healthy. And our family is elated,” they continued. 
 Jenna Bush Hager, 31, announced in December that she was expecting her first child, who is also the first grandchild for the former president and his wife. At the time, she said she was “nervous and so excited” about the pregnancy.
