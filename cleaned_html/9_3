Former GOP Senate nominee Joe Miller is moving toward another Senate bid in Alaska, forming an exploratory committee to challenge Sen. Mark Begich (D-Alaska) and writing an open letter discussing his interest in the seat. "The choice before Alaskans in 2014 will be stark. Voters must choose between the easy lies of an insider politician or the hard truth of a reformer," Miller writes on his website. "As of the writing of this article, I am unaware of another potential candidate who has demonstrated a willingness to challenge the status quo, and confront the culture of corruption that reaches to the highest levels of American government."    		 
	Miller, a Tea Party favorite who beat Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) in a 2010 GOP primary only to lose to her in the general election after she mounted a write-in campaign, is viewed as a weak general election candidate against Begich. But he could give the state party headaches in the primary. Begich is a top GOP target this election cycle, but he'll be tough to beat. Polls show he's fairly popular in the state despite its conservative lean, and he announced on Friday he'd raised $935,000 for his reelection, a big haul for the inexpensive state. Others looking at running against him include Alaska Gov. Sean Parnell (R) and Lt. Gov. Mead Treadwell (R).
